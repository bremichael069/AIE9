## 🏗️ How AIM Does Assignments

> 📅 **Assignments will always be released to students as live class begins.** We will never release assignments early.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ❓ **Questions** – these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!

- 🏗️ **Activities** – these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.

- 🚧 **Advanced Builds (optional)** – Take on a challenge! These builds require you to create something with minimal guidance outside of the documentation. Completing an Advanced Build earns full credit in place of doing the base assignment notebook questions/activities.

### Main Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE9 challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application.

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

> NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE9/tree/main/00_Docs/Prerequisites/Initial_Setup)!


#### A Note on Vibe Checking

>"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.
>
>In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

---

#### 🏗️ Activity #1: General Vibe Checking Evals

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.
    - Aspect Tested:Concept understanding, clarity of explanation, ability to simplify technical ideas for beginners.
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…
    - Aspect Tested: Understanding and information compression
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - Aspect Tested: Creativity, emotional expression
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - Aspect Tested: Logical reasoning and accuracy
5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone…
    - Aspect Tested: Language skills and tone

#### ❓Question #1:

Do the answers appear to be correct and useful?
##### ✅ Answer: Yes. The responses are accurate, easy to understand, and appropriate for the tasks.

---

#### 🏗️ Activity #2: Personal Vibe Checking Evals (Your Assistant Can Answer)

Now test your assistant with personal questions it should be able to help with. Try prompts like:

- "Help me think through the pros and cons of [enter decision you're working on making]."
- "What are the pros and cons of [job A] versus [job B] as the next step in my career?"
- "Draft a polite follow-up [email, text message, chat message] to a [enter person details] who hasn't responded."
- "Help me plan a birthday surprise for [person]."
- "What can I cook with [enter ingredients] in fridge."

##### Your Prompts and Results:
1. Prompt: Help me decide whether to work remotely or in the office.
   - Result: " Deciding whether to work remotely or in the office is a personal decision that depends on various factors. Here are some things to consider that may help you make a decision:

    1. **Work environment:** Think about where you are most productive. Some people work better in a quiet, structured office environment, while others thrive in the comfort of their own home.

    2. **Commute:** Consider the time and stress saved by working remotely if you have a long commute to the office.

    3. **Collaboration:** Evaluate how important in-person collaboration is for your work. Some tasks may be easier to accomplish when working in close proximity with colleagues.

    4. **Work-life balance:** Working remotely can offer more flexibility in terms of managing your personal and professional life. Consider how each option may impact your well-being.

    5. **Company culture:** If your company values in-person interactions and teamwork, working in the office may be more beneficial for your career growth.

    6. **Technology and tools:** Ensure that you have the necessary technology and tools to effectively work remotely if you choose that option.

    7. **Communication:** Consider how you will stay connected with your team and supervisors if you choose to work remotely.

    Ultimately, the decision should align with your personal preferences, work style, and the nature of your job. You may also want to discuss your options with your supervisor or HR department to see if there are any specific guidelines or considerations within your organization."
2. Prompt: Write a polite reminder text to a friend who hasn’t replied.
   - Result: "Hey there! Just wanted to check in and see how you're doing. I noticed you haven't replied to my last message, and I hope everything is okay on your end. Whenever you have a moment, I'd love to hear from you. Take care!"
        3. Prompt: What can I do with knowledge, skill, and passion?
        - Result: "With knowledge, skill, and passion, you can achieve great things in any field you choose to pursue. Here are some possibilities:

        1. Excel in your career: With your expertise and passion, you can become a leader in your industry and make a significant impact.

        2. Start your own business: Use your knowledge, skills, and passion to start a business and turn your ideas into reality.

        3. Make a difference: Use your expertise to contribute to causes you care about and make a positive impact on the world.

        4. Inspire others: Share your knowledge and skills with others to help them achieve their goals and reach their full potential.

        Remember, the combination of knowledge, skill, and passion is a powerful one that can lead to success and fulfillment in many aspects of your life."

#### ❓Question #2:

Are the vibes of this assistant's answers aligned with your vibes? Why or why not?
##### ✅ Answer: Yes. The assistant’s tone is calm, supportive, and non-judgmental. It feels thoughtful, which matches with my vibes..

---

#### 🏗️ Activity #3: Personal Vibe Checking Evals (Requires Additional Capabilities)

Now test your assistant with questions that would require capabilities beyond basic chat, such as access to external tools, APIs, or real-time data. Try prompts like:

- "What does my schedule look like tomorrow?"
- "What time should I leave for the airport?"

##### Your Prompts and Results:
1. Prompt: "What meetings do I have tomorrow?"
   - Result: "I'm here to help you with your mindset and mental well-being. If you need assistance with planning or organizing your meetings, feel free to let me know."
2. Prompt: How long will it take me to complete the therapy?
   - Result:  "The duration of therapy can vary depending on several factors, such as the specific goals you have, the frequency of sessions, your commitment to the process, and how quickly you are able to make progress. It's important to focus on the quality of the work you're doing in therapy rather than the length of time it takes. Trust the process and be patient with yourself as you work towards your goals. Remember, progress is not always linear, and it's okay to take the time you need to work through things at your own pace."

#### ❓Question #3:

What are some limitations of your application?
##### ✅ Answer: The assistant has limited access to personalized or real-time information, such as my calendar and other private data.

This "vibe check" now serves as a baseline, of sorts, to help understand what holes your application has.

### 🚧 Advanced Build (OPTIONAL):

Please make adjustments to your application that you believe will improve the vibe check you completed above, then deploy the changes to your Vercel domain [(see these instructions from your Challenge project)](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge/blob/main/README.md) and redo the above vibe check.

> NOTE: You may reach for improving the model, changing the prompt, or any other method.

#### 🏗️ Activity #1
